# Nuxtron
The best way to create desktop applications with Nuxt and Electron

## Features

* ðŸš€ Enjoy all the benefits of Nuxt, such as SSR, server API, code splitting and more
* ðŸ“¦ Start with a simple template that you can customize to your needs

## Why
1. Develop your app in the browser with hot module replacement and Vue devtools
2. Avoid tedious IPC communication between main and renderer processes
3. Write minimal main process code and restart it less often
4. Care about Electron only when you need to build and distribute your app
